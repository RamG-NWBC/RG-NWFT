## Overview and Origin

* Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/) is a crowdfunding platform that allows individuals or groups to collect funds for creative projects by soliciting modest sums of money from a large number of people, generally over the internet. It is a for-profit firm formed in 2009 that serves as a global crowdfunding platform for creative initiatives in fields such as art, music, cinema, technology, and others. Kickstarter has enabled creators to present their ideas to the public and obtain funding from supporters who support their work, resulting in the completion of thousands of projects.

* When was the company incorporated?
  2009

* Who are the founders of the company?

  Kickstarter was founded in 2009 by Perry Chen, Yancey Strickler, and Charles Adler. The company is headquartered in Brooklyn, New York.

  Perry Chen is a New Orleans-born artist, musician, and entrepreneur who co-founded Kickstarter in 2009. He serves as the company's CEO.

  Yancey Strickler is a writer and entrepreneur who co-founded Kickstarter in 2009. He serves as the company's Chief Strategy Officer.

  Charles Adler is a designer and entrepreneur who co-founded Kickstarter in 2009. He served as the company's Chief Design Officer until leaving the company in 2013.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea for Kickstarter originated from co-founder Perry Chen's experience as a musician and event organizer. Chen planned a concert in New Orleans in 2002 but struggled to get funding. He eventually took out a loan and used credit cards to pay for the concert, but the experience left him frustrated and motivated to discover a better method to support creative initiatives.

Chen developed the concept in 2005 to build a platform that would allow people to financially support creative projects before they were done. He discussed the idea with his friend Yancey Strickler, and together they proceeded to build the Kickstarter concept. They launched the Kickstarter website in 2009, with the assistance of designer Charles Adler, and the rest is history.


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Kickstarter was founded as a way to democratize the process of bringing creative projects to life. The founders believed that anyone with a good idea should have the opportunity to bring it to fruition, regardless of their financial resources or connections. Since its founding, Kickstarter has helped thousands of projects come to fruition and has become a well-known and trusted platform for crowdfunding creative projects.

Kickstarter is a for-profit company that earns money by charging a percentage charge on successful campaigns. When a Kickstarter project reaches its funding target, the company takes a 5% cut of the funds raised. If the project fails to meet its financing objective, no funds are collected and no fee is levied. In addition to this cost, successful campaigns are subject to a payment processing fee of roughly 3-5%.

Kickstarter's funding amount is not publicly available because the company is privately held and has not revealed this information. It is important to note, however, that Kickstarter is not supported by typical venture capital. Instead, the corporation makes money by charging fees for successful advertising. Kickstarter can remain autonomous and focused on its purpose of promoting creative projects and communities thanks to this arrangement. However, it is worth mentioning that since its start in 2009, Kickstarter had received $6.6 billion in pledges from 21 million contributors as of July 2021, funding 222,000 projects such as films, music, stage plays, comics, journalism, video games, board games, technology, publishing, and food-related ventures. Everette Taylor the current CEO of Kickstarter from September 2022 indicated in an interview with Bloomberg in October 2022, that it had been profitable since year 2.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that tries to tackle the problem of creative project financial access. Many creative projects, particularly those in the arts and media, require significant upfront funding. However, traditional forms of financing, such as loans or investments, are often difficult to secure for these projects. As a result of a lack of money, many creative ideas go unrealized or are considerably delayed.

Kickstarter seeks to address this issue by offering a venue for creators to present their ideas to the public and earn small sums of financing from a large number of backers. This enables artists to raise the funds required to bring their projects to fruition without relying on traditional means of financing. In this sense, Kickstarter serves to democratize the process of bringing creative ideas to life, giving anybody with a good idea a chance to make it a reality.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Kickstarter's intended customers are creators looking for money for creative projects in a range of areas such as art, music, cinema, technology, and more. These creators can be individuals, groups, or organizations based anywhere in the world.

As a result, Kickstarter's target demographic is fairly broad, and it includes anyone with a creative concept that they want to bring to reality. The company does not provide particular market size figures because it is difficult to determine the number of potential creators who may seek funding through the platform.
